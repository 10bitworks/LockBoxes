# LockBoxes
This is the repository for creating a RFID lock Box for power tools in 10Bitworks makerspace.

The intention of this design is to;

1-Create a access point that prevents usage of dangerous equipment by those not trained to use it

2-Check the credentials of individuals based on RFID badges to check for training records

3-Create a log of machine usage, may be involved in a machine usage charge system later on.
